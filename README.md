# GenderRecognition-IE
This is my Midterm project of IE course.

this file is for some explanations for the project.

#this project has 1 html file(index.htm) and 3 folders:

    1) the styles folder that css file is in there.
    2) images folder that contians some images and I used one of them.
    3) scripts folder that contians 2 files(index.js and index2.js)them.

#in the scripts folder there is 2 javascript codes:

    1) index.js is implementation using cookie.
    2) index2.js is implementation using local-storage.

in html file in line 92 I set default as index2.js (local-storage implementation).

in js codes I added some logs in some places of the code for debuging
you can see this logs in browser's inspect elements in (console part).
